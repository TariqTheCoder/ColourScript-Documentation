or go to https://pypi.org/project/ColourScript/ and download it there, by going to the 'Download Files section, and downloading the .whl file or the tar.gz file on Linux.


After you have installed it, make sure you have Python installed, by typing:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ python --version

if it does not display an error, Python is installed. You can install python at https://python.org.


Test out ColourScript with this code:

..code-block:: python

   import ColourScript.functions as cs
   cs.text.red("Hello World")

This sample code should display red text in the computer console or in your Python IDE.
